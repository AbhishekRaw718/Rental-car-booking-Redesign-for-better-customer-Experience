# 🚗 Enterprise Booking Feedback Loop – Product Redesign Case Study  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on redesigning **Enterprise Car Rentals’ booking system** to solve a persistent customer pain point:  
➡️ Customers receive a confirmed reservation but, upon arrival, are told that **no vehicle is available**.  

This creates wasted time, broken trust, and long-term customer churn. The proposed **Enterprise Booking Feedback Loop** introduces a **closed-loop, feedback-driven system** to ensure that every confirmed booking equals a guaranteed car.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- **Customer Impact:** Wasted time, last-minute disruptions, loss of trust.  
- **Business Impact:** Increased churn, reduced loyalty, lost market share to Hertz, Avis, and Turo.  
- **Brand Impact:** Perceived as unreliable despite Enterprise’s reputation for convenience and scale.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Redesign  
The new system introduces safeguards and predictive intelligence:  

- **Confirmation Gate:** Validates bookings against **real-time inventory** and checks for backup availability.  
- **Return Buffer Check:** Adds buffer windows for cleaning, fueling, and delays before reassigning cars.  
- **Smart Backup Allocation:** Assigns backup vehicles **only for short-gap overlaps**, ensuring efficient utilization.  
- **Extension Handling:** Rechecks inventory when renters extend trips at the last minute.  
- **Customer Notifications:** Proactive alerts for upgrades, risks, or compensation.  
- **Compensation Policy:** Vouchers, credits, or loyalty points if no vehicle is provided.  
- **Staff Dashboard:** Predictive alerts for frontline staff to manage risks before they impact customers.  
- **Feedback Loop:** AI-driven adjustments to buffer times, risk thresholds, and fleet optimization.

**Phase 2 (3–6 months): Secondary Priority Regions**  
- Regions with moderate churn, high volume.  
- Features: Backup allocation, automated compensation.  
- Success: NPS ↑10–12 points, fleet efficiency +10%.  

**Phase 3 (6–9 months): Stable Regions**  
- Locations with low churn, consistent volume.  
- Features: Extension handling, proactive notifications.  
- Success: Global churn ↓25%.  

**Phase 4 (9–12 months): Global Rollout**
