# 🚗 Enterprise Booking Feedback Loop – Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This case study explores a **redesign of Enterprise Car Rentals’ booking system** to solve one of its most pressing issues: customers receiving confirmed reservations but finding no vehicle at pickup. The proposed **closed-loop booking feedback system** introduces validation, predictive checks, and adaptive policies to ensure every confirmed booking results in a guaranteed vehicle.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customers frequently encounter situations where a **confirmed reservation does not result in a vehicle** at pickup. This leads to:
- Wasted time and frustration.
- Erosion of trust in Enterprise’s brand promise.
- Loss of customers to competitors like Hertz, Avis, and Turo.

---

## 💡 Proposed Redesign
The redesigned system introduces a **feedback-driven booking flow** with the following key features:
- **Confirmation Gate:** Validate bookings against real-time inventory and backup availability.
- **Return Buffer Check:** Ensure cars returning before pickup have adequate buffer time (fueling/cleaning).
- **Backup Allocation:** Assign backup vehicles only when short gaps exist, avoiding underutilization.
- **Extension Handling:** Re-check conflicts when active renters extend trips.
- **Customer Notification:** Proactive updates on upgrades, risks, or changes.
- **Compensation Policy:** Automatic vouchers or credits if no vehicle can be provided.
- **Staff Dashboard:** Predictive alerts for branch staff to prevent failures.
- **Feedback Loop:** AI-driven learning from delays, extensions, and churn patterns.

## 📊 Product Roadmap (Phased Rollout)
The rollout prioritizes **regions with the highest churn and booking failures**, then expands globally.

- **Phase 1 (0–3 months):** Pilot in top 5 high-churn regions.  
- **Phase 2 (3–6 months):** Expand to secondary priority markets.  
- **Phase 3 (6–9 months):** Extend to stable/low-risk regions.  
- **Phase 4 (9–12 months):** Global rollout with predictive dashboards.  
- **Phase 5 (12+ months):** Optimization, loyalty integration, and ecosystem partnerships.

## 📈 Metrics of Success (KPIs)
- **Booking Fulfillment Rate:** ≥95% confirmed reservations fulfilled.  
- **NPS Improvement:** +15 to +20 point lift in customer satisfaction.  
- **Cancellation Reduction:** 40% fewer last-minute cancellations.  
- **Churn Reduction:** 25–30% decrease in customer attrition.  
- **Fleet Utilization:** 10–15% efficiency improvement.

## 🛠️ Risks & Mitigations
- **Technical:** API sync issues → Phased rollout + redundancy.  
- **Operational:** Staff adoption challenges → Training + dashboards.  
- **Customer:** Overly strict buffers → Adaptive AI-driven policies.  
- **Market:** Competitor replication → Branding as “Guaranteed Reservation.”
